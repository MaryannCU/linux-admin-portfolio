Linux Server Hardening (Task 1)

This project demonstrates **basic server hardening and security setup** on an Ubuntu server (AWS EC2 instance).  
It’s part of my journey as a **Systems Administrator & Cloud Engineer** to practice and showcase hands-on skills.


What I Did
- Set up a new **Ubuntu server** on AWS EC2.  
- Applied **firewall rules** using UFW:
  - Deny all incoming traffic by default.  
  - Allow outgoing traffic.  
  - Enable & limit SSH access.  
- Installed and configured **Fail2Ban** to protect against brute-force attacks.  
- Enabled **Unattended Upgrades** for automatic security updates.  
- Collected and saved server security configuration files as proof of work.  

Project Files
- `sshd-settings.txt` → Current SSH configuration.  
- `ufw-status.txt` → Firewall rules & status.  
- `fail2ban-status.txt` → Fail2Ban active status.  
- `unattended-upgrades-status.txt` → Auto-updates service status.  
- `unattended-dry-run.txt` → Dry-run of unattended upgrades.  

Skills Demonstrated
- Linux administration (Ubuntu)  
- Cloud server setup (AWS EC2)  
- Security hardening (SSH, UFW, Fail2Ban)  
- Automation with shell commands  
- Git & GitHub portfolio building
