This folder contains all the artifacts captured during Task 2 of my Linux Server Hardening project:

- `cpu_usage-alert.txt`
- `fail2ban-status.txt`
- `sshd-settings.txt`
- `ufw-status.txt`
- `unattended-dry-run.txt`
- `unattended-upgrades-status.txt`

These files were collected from the EC2 Ubuntu server to document server hardening and monitoring setup.
